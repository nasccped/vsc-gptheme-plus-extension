## Special Thanks

Here I bring some **special thanks** to the people who helped me
along the way (sorry to those I forgot 😩):

### Thanks to:

- **Coder Coder** [[github][the-coder-coder-github]]

  If it weren't for the
  [video provided on YouTube][the-coder-coder-video], I certainly
  wouldn't have gotten as far as I did. I arrived! ❤️


- **Christian Lempa** [[github][christian-lempa-github]]

  Another one who played a crucial role in resolving the project with
  his [video on YouTube][christian-lempa-video]. The video in the
  item above was very complete, but this guy's video also helped me
  along the way. 🤝


- **NodeJS/NPM development team** [[node page][nodejs-website] /
[npm page][npm-website]] 

  If it weren't for the tools they developed, this project would not
  be possible. 👷‍♂️


- **VS Code Theme Studio development team** [[website][theme-maker-website]]

  The website was not mentioned throughout the documentation, but its
  importance is undeniable in terms of the success achieved. Thank
  y'all guys! 📠


- **Material Theme development team** [[github repo][material-theme-link]]

  One of the main repositories used as a reference for building this
  project. Thank y'all guys! 🫡


- **Night Owl Theme development team** [[github repo][night-owl-theme-link]]

  Another repository that I was able to get support from by studying
  its structure, whether in documentation or in development. Thank
  y'all guys! 🫡


- **DIO developers team** [[github repo][dio-repo-link]]

  These in turn contribute more to the construction of documentation
  than the project itself, even so, I make a point of mentioning them
  in the list! 😄


And thank you for getting here! Believe me, if there was no one to
use the project, read the documentation, etc. This project probably
wouldn't even exist. So, you were my biggest inspiration! 🫂

Thank **you guys** and keep coding! ❤️
