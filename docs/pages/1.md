<!-- content begin ------------------------------------------------->
Semantically speaking 🤓☝️, the first name is easy to understand. We
have the acronyms ***'GPT'*** which comes from the name of the AI
itself in which the project was inspired, and then we have
***'Theme'*** which, well... means theme. 🤯

But... what about ***'Plus'***? Where does it come from? 🤔

This is not the first published version of **'GPTheme'**. The
extension has already had two other previous versions.

I struggled with using tools like *Git* and *GitHub*, and working
with Azure DevOps was a nightmare 😵‍💫. I was often confused about the
commands and buttons. The repository became disorganized and
cluttered, to the point where starting over from scratch seemed
easier.

After casting the project aside for a month, picked it back up again,
and then I realized there was new knowledge I could implement

In order not to create **several versions** of the **same project**,
and with the **same name**, I made a change to the naming of the
final project. And here is **GPTheme Plus!**
