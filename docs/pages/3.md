<!-- content begins ------------------------------------------------>
I believe that there are several different ways of doing something,
especially when it comes to programming and development. That's why
I'm going to mention here the way I did it 🏎️💨

<!-- preparing tools section --------------------------------------->
## Preparing tools

In this section I will list a series of tools that I used and that
you can also use ⚒️

- **VS Code** *(obviously)*

  Well, if you intend to make an extension for VS Code, you will
  clearly need VS Code. 🤯

  You can download it by clicking [here 📦][vs-code-download-link]

- **NodeJS**

  NodeJS will be a very important tool as it will have NPM (Node
  Package Manager) and later, interaction with the yeoman! 🎩
  
  You can download it by clicking [here 📦][node-download-link]

- **Git**

  If you want to do exceptional work that grows fluidly without
  running the risk of falling apart, you'll probably want to have
  **Git** installed on your machine. 🎋

  You can download it by clicking [here 📦][git-download-link]

- **VS Code Theme Maker** *(web tool)*

  You don't necessarily have to use this tool, but I confess that it
  helped me a lot in numerous stages of development, so thinking
  about it this way, it can help you too! 😅

  Unlike the ones mentioned above, this tool is not the type that you
  download, but rather that you use. It is a web page that you can
  access by clicking [here 🔍][theme-maker-link]

## How to perform with these tools

In order to keep the documentation as succinct as possible, I won't
go into too much detail about what you should do to start, develop
and publish your project. Instead, I will leave this task to the
videos that helped me in the process 📽️

- [Create a VS Code theme + publish on marketplace!][christian-lempa-video]
- [How to create a Custom VS Code Theme in 3 minutes (2022)][virej-video]

<!-- experience section / suggestions ------------------------------>
## My experience 'n suggestions

As soon as possible? OK... 🏎️💨

<!-- as a developer subsection -->
### As a developer

Well, as a developer it was one of the richest experiences I could
get. Taking away the means of help (AI, StackOverflow, Youtube,
etc.), I did the entire project alone and was able to learn in the
most painful and at the same time the most effective way:
**Trial and Error!** 🚦

I learned how to start a project, how to maintain it, how to
contribute and receive contributions. 🤝

I learned how to use the Git and GitHub tool in a high
performance. 👨‍💻

I learned to solve difficult problems and get around impossible
problems. 🧱

I learned that even if I gave up more than twice there was nothing
stopping me from trying again. 🧘‍♂️

I learned that carrying out a project that isn't worth anything can
still be worth a lot! 🍃

<!-- as a person subsection -->
### As a person

Did you feel that the words in the section above were inspiring? So
you can prepare yourself because this one will show just the
opposite! 😵‍💫

While as a developer, everything was very amazing, as a person, I
faced difficulties that I still fear today.

Probably the biggest enemy that a beginning developer can have is
perfectionism. Just imagine:

- You start to make a project

- Stop doing it because you encounter a difficulty

- Spend a few weeks or even months without moving on the same project

- When you return, you have already learned countless new things that
you would like to implement

- You're ashamed of what you've built so far

- Restart the project

- And it goes into a loop

I don't even need to mention how exhausting this can be. I believe
that it doesn't matter the age or experience... Regardless of the
person, anyone who goes through this situation poses a serious
risk to their personal and professional health. 🤒

And precisely for this reason I created the next section ⬇️

<!-- my suggestions subsection -->
### My suggestions

To start the list of suggestions, I will ask a simple question:

Did you know when you want to do something cool as quickly as
possible but before you start you need to learn a series of things? 🗺️

And even after knowing this, do you still think something like:

> Oh I'm going to skip this part, it can't be important

Well... these things are actually important, a lot.

If the rush hadn't stopped me from following the right path at the
right speed, I probably wouldn't have gone through half the problems
I went through.
