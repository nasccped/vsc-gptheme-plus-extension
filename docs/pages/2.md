<!-- content begins ------------------------------------------------>
Here are some recommendations so that you can take advantage of the
extension with the greatest possible flexibility. 👨‍💻👩‍💻

<br>


<!-- health section ------------------------------------------------>
## First of all, your health

If you like using the final product, know that it makes me immensely
happy 😆, but here we will look at some important issues related
to your health 🚑

By default, **GPTheme** tries to simulate the **ChatGPT code style**
as much as possible!

This is precisely his objective, however, this style can often be too
dark in certain situations.

Using your machine in a very bright place or under other certain
conditions can make it difficult to see the screen, which can damage
your vision (often permanently). 🚫

Make sure you are in a nice place so you can make the most of our
product!

<!-- font family section ------------------------------------------->
## Font Family

This is a very personal part that will vary from person to person.

Not to mention that changing the font that is displayed on the screen
can directly affect visibility and readability 👓 (subject covered in
the section above).

Well, currently the font I use is `Roboto Mono`. It's really cool but
it's always good to remember that we have other alternatives like
`Source Code Pro` and `Jet Brains Mono`.

If you want to change the font of your VS Code, just open the
settings panel by clicking `Ctrl` (`⌘` if you're in Mac) + `,`. Then
go to the area: `**Editor:** Font Family` and put the desired font in
the textbox such as:

```
'First Font', Second, 'Last Option'
```

Consider:

  - `'First Font'`: The font that you want to use 🥇
  - `Second`: The font that will be used if the previous is
  unavailable 🥈
  - `'Last Option'`: I think you already understand 🥉

> [!TIP]
>
> Note that some fonts are enclosed in quotation marks and others are
> not.
>
> This is why when a font has a compound name (more than one word),
> its full name needs to be inserted within quotation marks.
>
> Don't forget this if you want to change the font

---

Or you can also change the font from VS Code's **settings.json**,
which **I don't recommend** especially for those who are new to the
software:

Open the settings panel in the same way as mentioned earlier. ⬆️

In the top right corner you will find several different buttons.

Click on the one with the description `'Open Settings (JSON)'` and
write the following line in the json file:

```json
  "editor.fontFamily" : "'Compound Name Font', SimpleFont"
```

> [!WARNING]

> The examples above are just illustrative, you should actually
> replace the names used by the fonts you want ✍️
>
> ---
>
> Although it may seem obvious, don't forget that if you don't
> already have the font installed on your machine, you need to:
>
> - install in your system 📦 *(obviously)*
> - Open your VS Code 🕹️ *(reload if it's already open)*
> - Do the changes ✍️

<!-- extra section ------------------------------------------------->
## Extra

This section was separated for those personal suggestions that are
not as impactful but that I would like to pass on! 🤚

- Go to settings panel *(mentioned previously)* and:
  
  - Turn the Inlay Hinst > `off`

    Inlay Hints in VS Code are like placeholders that remain in the
    input even after you enter the answer. 🏷️

    For many this is a help, but for me particularly it is just
    another problem that I will face during an alignment with
    indentation.
  
  - Uncheck the Bracket Pair Colorization

    If when you search for **Bracket Pair Colorization** in the
    settings panel something like this appears:

    - [x]

    You can click on this and leave it like this:

    - [ ]

    ---

    Basically, when you do this, you disable the color of the bracket
    pairs, leaving the extension more similar to your original
    proposal. 🚫🎨

    ⚠️ Can significantly impact code readability!
