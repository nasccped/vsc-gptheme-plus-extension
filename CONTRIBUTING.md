# Contributing

Hello! If you're here, it's probably because you're asking yourself:
*'The project is really cool, is there any way I can help? 🤔'*

Well... if you're wondering that, this page is for you! 😁

Else, you can turn back to the [main page 🏠][project-repo-href]

<!-- pull requests section ----------------------------------------->
## About Pull Requests

For now, there will be no availability to make pull requests. 🚫

Thinking about to maintain the source code organization the project
will not have support for pull requests *(but it will support
**issues**, a subject covered in the next section)*!

<!-- issues section ------------------------------------------------>
## About Issues

Now, talking about issues, the repository becomes much more flexible.

As it is a considerably large project, different models for issues
will be made available. The issue may be related to:

- project:
  - a critical bug 🐞
  - a small suggestion 🤓☝️
  - something doesn't work as it should 📋
  - ...

- documentation:
  - A link that goes nowhere 🌙
  - A wrong info 🗯️
  - ...

Some issues may take time to be addressed, or may not be addressed as
expected. Sorry for that! 😖

<!-- can you be a contributor too? --------------------------------->
## Can I be a contributor too?

For reasons of organization and more efficient scalability, for now
the project will not offer support for adding contributors. 😢

The contributors tag will only be available to a very small group of
people who I believe can help me in the best way...

This way I can maintain a better projection of maintenance and
updates 🌱 > 🪴 > 🌲
