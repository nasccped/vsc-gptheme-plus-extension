<!-- license section ----------------------------------------------->
## License

Here we enter a somewhat sensitive topic. Even though I created the
extension, the idea didn't come directly from me. 💡

All the extension does is simulate an appearance style that has
existed for a long time. So, those responsible for the color palette,
fonts and etc. are, in general, the team of developers at
[OpenAi][openai-website], [Microsoft][microsoft-website] and those
involved 👩‍🔬👨‍🔬

Despite all this, the extension is governed by the **MIT license
⚖️**, which you can access by [clicking here][license-href]!
