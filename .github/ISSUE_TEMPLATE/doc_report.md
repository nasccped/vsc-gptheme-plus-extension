<!-- about the problem --------------------------------------------->
**The problem 🚨**

If you are here it is because you found some problem in the
documentation. Sometimes these errors can be a mistake on the part of
the project maintainer, therefore, an important question to ask to
solve this problem is: could you tell me what problem you have
found? 💬

<!-- locating the problem ------------------------------------------>
**Say where 🛣️**

In order to be more efficient, it is extremely important that you
carefully detail where this problem was found. Answer the items:

- **Path:** path-to-the/file-where-the/problem-was-found *(You can't
forget to answer this 💀)*

- **Section:** If the problem is in a **.md file**, you can see that
between the text sections there are long comments *(which serve to
separate the sections)*. Write the target section here, if it exists
📦

mention the line where you found the problem ✍️
